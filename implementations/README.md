# Neural Network Implementations

These are all implemented from scratch, without much reference to the Jupyter
Notebook provided in the assignments.

## Why?

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

The above is one of my favorite quotes by Richard Feynman - I learn best through
practice, and I feel that some of the programming assignments in the course was
too easy and spoon-fed to us. That being said, it is understandable that the
assignments (and the course in general) are catered for a wider range of
audience, hence it has to be toned down a little.

Therefore I took the effort to reimplement some of the neural networks in the
course to reinforce my understanding. Also adding a little bit more Python flair
to it.

## Getting Started

WIP.

## Tests

## Contributing

Feel free to provide comments on my implementations and better ways to do it.
I tried to steer away from the 'helper function' method and add some structure
to the program. This might not be the best way and I am always open for
discussion. :)

Also feel free to fork these for your own learning purposes too!

**NOTE**: You won't find direct answers for the Coursera programming assignments
here. Although you can identify some pieces of nuggets here and there. Still
recommended to go through the assignments before looking at these. :)
