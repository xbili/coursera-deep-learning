    "This regression is used when we want to classify into $C$ different classes. The output layer will then tell us the probability of each class given the training data, $X$.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Calculate $t = e^{z^{[l]}}$\n",
    "2. Calculate the sum $\\sum t_i$\n",
    "3. Divide result obtained in step 1 by that obtained in step 2\n",

    "Note that if $C = 2$, softmax reduces to a logistic regression."

    "\n",
    "To calculate the loss function to optimize for a softmax layer, we use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{y}, y) = - \\sum_{j=1}^{C} y_j \\log \\hat{y}_j$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$$J(W^{[1]}, b^{[1]}, \\dots) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\mathcal{L}(\\hat{y}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "In our backprop, we see that our `dz` will be $\\hat{y} - y$, which gives us a vector in the shape `(4, 1)`. But since we are doing programming assignments in programming frameworks from this week onwards, we do not need to know the backpropagation derivatives in detail."
