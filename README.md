# Coursera Deep Learning

These are my own notes in the form of Jupyter Notebooks from Andrew Ng's Coursera specialization on Deep Learning.

I figured that most of the concepts I learned from online courses tend to disappear from my memory a few weeks after completing the course. So I took the effort to translate my notes into nicely formatted Jupyter Notebooks so that I can look them up easily in the future.

Also, I implemented some of the neural networks from scratch (without the aid of Coursera provided Jupyter notebooks) to reinforce my understanding of the concepts.

**NOTE**: This repository does not contain any solutions to assignments in order to maintain the Coursera Honor Code.

## Contents

1. Neural Networks and Deep Learning
2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

## Getting Started

Feel free to fork this repository and add on to the notes that I have created.

Recommended to do this inside a `virtualenv` for Python dependency management.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

A browser window to `http://localhost:8888` should open up.
